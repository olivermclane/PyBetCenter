This basic tkinter application is a viewing application for all of the odds in sports betting. For this to work you do need to get a API-key.

Navigate to https://the-odds-api.com

Once there, scroll down and register for a free API KEY.

After registration is complete, the API KEY will be sent to your email. Copy that key into a .env file with the env variable called API-KEY.

```{python}
API_KEY="{your_api_key}"
```
Once this is complete, run main.py and enjoy the a UI to explore differnet head to head odds and outright odds.
